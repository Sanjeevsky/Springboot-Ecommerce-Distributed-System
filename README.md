## Architecture

[Live Architecture Diagram](https://sanjeevsky.github.io/Springboot-Ecommerce-Distributed-System/architecture.html)

**15 Spring services** plus platform infrastructure across 3 tiers:

| Tier | Services |
|------|----------|
| Infrastructure | MySQL 8.0, Redis 7.2, Kafka 3.5 (KRaft), Kafka Connect (Debezium CDC), Elasticsearch 7.13, Kafka UI, Zipkin, Prometheus, Grafana |
| Spring Cloud | Eureka (service-discovery), Config Server (cloud-config), Spring Boot Admin (spring-server), API Gateway |
| Business | auth, catalog, customer, order, shopping-cart, payment, inventory, notification, review, wishlist, coupon |

---

## Services

| Service | Port | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| frontend | 4173 | Trove storefront — React (Vite) SPA served by nginx, proxies `/api/*` to the gateway |
| service-discovery | 8761 | Eureka server — service registry |
| cloud-config | 8071 | Spring Cloud Config Server |
| spring-server | 9000 | Spring Boot Admin UI |
| kafka-ui | 8080 | Kafka topics, brokers, and consumer groups UI |
| api-gateway | 8081 | JWT auth + explicit standard-prefix routing to all services |
| auth-server | 8083 | Register / login / JWT issuance |
| catalog-service | 8084 | Products, categories, brands (Redis cached); full-text search + auto-suggest (Elasticsearch); real-time index sync via Debezium CDC |
| customer-service | 8082 | Customer profiles, address management |
| order-service | 8092 | Order lifecycle — create / confirm / cancel |
| shopping-cart-service | 8086 | Cart CRUD + checkout snapshot |
| payment-service | 8085 | Initiate / confirm / refund payments |
| inventory-service | 8088 | Stock management + reservation via Kafka |
| notification-service | 8087 | Persists order & payment events as notifications |
| review-service | 8090 | Reviews gated by purchase eligibility |
| wishlist-service | 8091 | Wishlist + move-to-cart |
| coupon-service | 8089 | Coupon create / validate / apply |

---

## Kafka Event Flows

```
order-service    ──► order-events ──► inventory-service
                                  ──► notification-service
                                  ──► review-service

order-service    ──► payment-commands ──► payment-service          (saga charge/refund)

payment-service  ──► payment-events ──► notification-service
                                    ──► order-service              (saga reply)

inventory-service ─► inventory-events ─► order-service
```

The distributed checkout is coordinated by an orchestration-based **[saga](docs/SAGA.md)**
(`reserve stock → charge payment → confirm order`, with compensation on failure).

Kafka consumers retry failed records twice with a 1 second backoff, then publish the original record to a dead-letter topic:

| Source topic | Dead-letter topic |
|--------------|-------------------|
| `order-events` | `order-events-dlt` |
| `payment-events` | `payment-events-dlt` |
| `inventory-events` | `inventory-events-dlt` |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker + Docker Compose
- Java 11 (`/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-11.jdk/Contents/Home` on Mac)
- Maven 3.8+

The local build and verification scripts prefer that Java 11 path automatically when it exists, even if your shell default is a newer JDK. Set `MAVEN_JAVA_HOME` to override the Maven runtime explicitly.

### 1. Build all services

```bash
scripts/build-docker-jars.sh
```

For a focused rebuild before Docker, pass module names:

```bash
scripts/build-docker-jars.sh api-gateway order-service
```

### 2. Run the full stack

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 3. Access services

| UI | URL |
|----|-----|
| Trove Storefront | http://localhost:4173 |
| Eureka Dashboard | http://localhost:8761 |
| Spring Boot Admin | http://localhost:9000 (client / client; optional `platform-tools` profile) |
| Kafka UI | http://localhost:8080 |
| Zipkin Traces | http://localhost:9411 |
| Prometheus | http://localhost:9090 |
| Grafana | http://localhost:3000 (admin / admin) |
| API Gateway | http://localhost:8081 |

The default `docker compose up -d` stack starts the application services plus Kafka UI, Zipkin, Prometheus, and Grafana. Spring Boot Admin is optional; start it with admin client registration enabled when you need the UI:

```bash
SPRING_BOOT_ADMIN_CLIENT_ENABLED=true docker compose --profile platform-tools up -d
```

Zipkin runs in the Docker stack, but service tracing is disabled by default to keep full-stack local verification within typical Docker Desktop memory limits. Set `SPRING_ZIPKIN_ENABLED=true` before `docker compose up` to emit spans.

Auth tokens are signed by `auth-server` and verified by `api-gateway`; both read the same `JWT_SECRET` value. Docker Compose defaults it to `local-dev-secret` for local runs, and you can override it before starting the stack.
Local infrastructure credentials keep development defaults but are overridable: `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` controls Docker MySQL and service datasource passwords, `MYSQL_PASSWORD` controls direct local service properties, and Spring Boot Admin uses `SPRING_SECURITY_USER_NAME` / `SPRING_SECURITY_USER_PASSWORD` for the server login plus `SPRING_BOOT_ADMIN_CLIENT_USERNAME` / `SPRING_BOOT_ADMIN_CLIENT_PASSWORD` for service registration. When overriding Spring Boot Admin in Docker, set the server and client username variables to the same value, and set the server and client password variables to the same value, so service registration continues to authenticate.
Docker Compose disables the Spring Cloud Config client for app containers so the local stack uses packaged service properties and does not try to resolve `localhost:8071` from inside containers. The `cloud-config` service still runs for manual config-server checks in native local mode, without cloning the remote config repository.
Application containers wait for `service-discovery` and `cloud-config` health before startup so Eureka registration is less race-prone during cold starts.
Application services default to the `dev` profile for Eureka-backed local runs; Docker Compose also sets `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev` explicitly.
`customer-service/src/main/resources/application-local.properties` is an opt-in isolated profile for direct customer-service debugging; it disables Eureka and is not used by Docker Compose or smoke verification.

The API Gateway uses explicit standard-prefix routes such as `/cart-service/**`, `/order-service/**`, and `/catalog-service/**`. Spring Cloud Gateway discovery-locator routes are disabled so raw service-id paths such as `/shopping-cart-service/**` are not exposed alongside the standard application routes.

**Frontend development:** the dockerized storefront on :4173 serves the production build. For hot-reload development run `cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev` — the Vite dev server on :5173 proxies `/api` to the gateway on :8081 (see `frontend/.env.example` for config).

Kafka broker endpoints:

| Use case | Endpoint |
|----------|----------|
| Docker-internal services and Kafka UI | `kafka:29092` |
| Host machine clients and CLI tools | `localhost:9092` |

## Testing Guide

This is the full runbook to bring the platform up and exercise **every business flow** end to end. Follow it top to bottom.

### Step 0 — Prerequisites (one time)

- Docker Desktop running (needs ~6–8 GB free for the full stack)
- Java 11 at `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-11.jdk/Contents/Home` (auto-detected; set `MAVEN_JAVA_HOME` to override)
- `node` (for the validators) and `newman` (`npm i -g newman`, for the Postman flows)

### Step 1 — Build the service jars

The Dockerfiles copy pre-built `target/*.jar`, so package them first. Re-run this whenever you change Java code.

```bash
scripts/build-docker-jars.sh
```

### Step 2 — Start the full stack

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts 21 containers: all 13 business services, Eureka, Config Server, API Gateway, plus MySQL, Redis, Kafka, Kafka UI, Zipkin, Prometheus, and Grafana. Services take ~30–60s to register with Eureka before routes are live.

### Step 3 — Run every flow (one command)

```bash
scripts/verify-local.sh
```

This is the authoritative end-to-end check. It waits for readiness (per-service health, Eureka registry, gateway route table, auth guards), then runs all three Postman collections through the gateway, and finally re-runs the Maven test suites. **A clean pass looks like this:**

| Phase | Expected result |
|-------|-----------------|
| Health + Eureka + gateway checks | all pass, no timeouts |
| API reference flow | 75 requests · 144 assertions · **0 failed** |
| Data seed flow | 25 requests · 58 assertions · **0 failed** |
| Complete E2E flow | 75 requests · 135 assertions · **0 failed** |
| Maven module tests | ~479 tests · **0 failures** |
| Exit code | `0` |

To run the live flows **without** re-running the unit tests (much faster — the live Postman flows are what actually exercise the running stack):

```bash
RUN_MAVEN_TESTS=0 scripts/verify-local.sh
```

### What the E2E flow covers

The complete E2E collection walks the real cross-service path through the gateway, asserting behavior at each step:

| # | Flow | What it verifies |
|---|------|------------------|
| 00 | **Auth** | Signup → login (JWT issued) → password update |
| 01 | **Catalog** | Create brand / category / subcategory / product / variant; list, search, get-by-id (Redis-cached) |
| 02 | **Inventory** | Set stock, read stock per product + variant, availability check |
| 03 | **Customer** | Address create / read / list / update / delete |
| 04 | **Cart** | Add items, update qty, checkout snapshot, remove, clear |
| 05 | **Wishlist** | Add, list, **move-to-cart** (cross-service Feign call), remove |
| 06 | **Coupon** | Create, list, validate, apply discount |
| 07 | **Order** | Create from cart, coupon discount applied, confirm, cancel, **insufficient-stock rejection (400)**, idempotency |
| 08 | **Payment** | Initiate, confirm, status, refund, **fail lifecycle**, idempotency |
| 09 | **Review** | Submit (purchase-gated), moderate → APPROVED, read approved reviews |

Kafka event propagation (`order-events`, `payment-events`, `inventory-events`) is exercised implicitly — the inventory, notification, and review consumers react to the orders and payments created above.

### Running a single flow / subset

```bash
# Skip the Maven suites, keep the live Postman flows
RUN_MAVEN_TESTS=0 scripts/verify-local.sh

# Run just the complete E2E flow (skip the others)
RUN_MAVEN_TESTS=0 RUN_API_COLLECTION=0 RUN_DATA_SEED_COLLECTION=0 scripts/verify-local.sh

# Run one collection directly against the running stack
newman run postman/Ecommerce-E2E-Complete.postman_collection.json \
  -e postman/Ecommerce-Local.postman_environment.json
```

For the full list of toggles (`RUN_POSTMAN`, `RUN_PLATFORM_ENDPOINT_CHECKS`, `GATEWAY_DISCOVERY_STABILIZE_SECONDS`, …) see [Verification](#verification) below.

### Manual spot-check (curl)

To sanity-check the gateway and auth by hand:

```bash
# Public route — product list (no token needed)
curl -s http://localhost:8081/catalog-service/product/list

# Register + login, capture the JWT
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8081/auth-service/signup \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"Test","email":"test@example.com","password":"pass1234"}'

TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8081/auth-service/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"pass1234"}' \
  | node -e 'process.stdin.on("data",d=>{const j=JSON.parse(d);console.log(j.data?.token||j.token)})')

# Authenticated route
curl -s http://localhost:8081/cart-service/cart -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

A protected route called **without** a token must return `401`; the raw `/shopping-cart-service/**` service-id path must return `404` (only the standard `/cart-service/**` prefix is exposed).

### Step 4 — Tear down

```bash
docker compose down                          # stops the default stack
docker compose --profile platform-tools down # also removes the optional Boot Admin container + network
```

## API Reference

Import the Postman collection from `postman/` for all endpoints.

Postman collections:

| Collection | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `Ecommerce-API.postman_collection.json` | Runner-safe endpoint reference/application collection with global non-2xx checks |
| `Ecommerce-DataSeed.postman_collection.json` | Runner-safe seed flow for local catalog, order, payment, approved review, wishlist, notification, and inventory data |
| `Ecommerce-E2E-Complete.postman_collection.json` | Runner-safe application E2E flow |
| `Ecommerce-Local.postman_environment.json` | Local gateway environment with only `baseUrl` |

The collections use collection-level scripts to generate and save run values such as token, IDs, coupon code, and idempotency keys into collection variables and the active runner environment. The local environment file intentionally provides only the gateway `baseUrl`; runtime state belongs to the collection scripts so Collection Runner and Newman can execute from a clean environment. Kafka-backed review eligibility and notification requests include runner retries so asynchronous consumers can catch up before later requests use `reviewId` or `notificationId`. The DataSeed collection moderates and verifies an approved review, and the application collections fail unexpected non-2xx responses while asserting key semantics such as coupon discounts, cancelled-order refunds, insufficient-inventory checkout rejection, and review moderation before approved-review reads.

### Authentication

```
POST /auth-service/signup
POST /auth-service/login         → returns JWT token
```

Signup, login, and catalog product browsing routes are public:

```
GET /catalog-service/product/list
GET /catalog-service/product/search
GET /catalog-service/product/getProduct/{id}
```

All other standard gateway routes, including `/auth-service/updatePassword`, require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

### Order flow

```
POST   /order-service/order           → create order from cart
PUT    /order-service/order/{id}/confirm
PUT    /order-service/order/{id}/cancel
GET    /order-service/order/{id}
GET    /order-service/orders
```

`POST /order-service/order` and `POST /payment-service/initiate` accept an optional `Idempotency-Key` header. Retries with the same key for the same user return the existing order/payment and do not replay side effects such as payment initiation, cart clearing, coupon application, or Kafka event publication. Reusing a key for a different order address/coupon, payment order, or payment amount returns `400 Bad Request`. The Postman runner collections generate per-run idempotency keys automatically.

Order creation pre-checks the current inventory entry for the exact product variant in the cart and returns `400 Bad Request` with an insufficient-stock message when requested quantity exceeds available stock.

---

## Verification

Static validation for Postman collections and service configuration:

```bash
node scripts/validate-postman.js
node scripts/validate-service-config.js
python3 generate-arch.py --check
bash -n scripts/verify-local.sh scripts/build-docker-jars.sh e2e-smoke-test.sh
docker compose config --quiet
docker compose --profile platform-tools config --quiet
```

Full local verification:

```bash
scripts/verify-local.sh
```

By default this runs the API reference collection, the DataSeed collection, and the complete E2E collection after local health, platform endpoint, per-app and aggregate Eureka registry, live gateway route-table, gateway route readiness, and gateway auth-guard checks across all standard service prefixes. Readiness includes `cloud-config` health, `CONFIGSERVER` Eureka registration, and Kafka UI, Zipkin, Prometheus, and Grafana endpoints.
The Maven phase runs `clean test` to avoid stale deleted classes; run `scripts/build-docker-jars.sh` again before any Docker image rebuild that needs fresh `target/*.jar` files.
If a health or Eureka readiness check times out, the script prints the last HTTP response or a compact Eureka registry snapshot so missing registrations are visible without opening the dashboard manually.

Legacy smoke entrypoint:

```bash
./e2e-smoke-test.sh
```

`e2e-smoke-test.sh` delegates to the Postman-backed local verifier with Maven tests skipped by default.

Useful switches:

```bash
RUN_POSTMAN=0 scripts/verify-local.sh       # skip Docker-stack Postman runner checks
RUN_API_COLLECTION=0 scripts/verify-local.sh # skip API reference collection, keep DataSeed + E2E
RUN_DATA_SEED_COLLECTION=0 scripts/verify-local.sh # skip DataSeed collection
RUN_E2E_COLLECTION=0 scripts/verify-local.sh # skip complete E2E collection
RUN_PLATFORM_ENDPOINT_CHECKS=0 scripts/verify-local.sh # skip Kafka UI, Zipkin, Prometheus, and Grafana endpoint checks
RUN_MAVEN_TESTS=0 scripts/verify-local.sh   # skip Maven module tests
MAVEN_JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk11 scripts/verify-local.sh # override Maven Java runtime
GATEWAY_DISCOVERY_STABILIZE_SECONDS=0 scripts/verify-local.sh  # disable post-Eureka gateway cache wait
```

Local runner checks after the Docker stack is up:

```bash
newman run postman/Ecommerce-API.postman_collection.json \
  -e postman/Ecommerce-Local.postman_environment.json \
  --bail failure \
  --timeout-request 30000 \
  --delay-request 100

newman run postman/Ecommerce-DataSeed.postman_collection.json \
  -e postman/Ecommerce-Local.postman_environment.json

newman run postman/Ecommerce-E2E-Complete.postman_collection.json \
  -e postman/Ecommerce-Local.postman_environment.json
```

Targeted Java test example:

```bash
JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-11.jdk/Contents/Home \
  mvn -B -f auth-server/pom.xml clean test -DfailIfNoTests=false "-Dtest=!*ApplicationTests"
```

GitHub Actions runs static validation and Java 11 module tests on pushes and pull requests.
